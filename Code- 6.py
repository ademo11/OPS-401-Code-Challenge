# Purpose: Ops Challenge: File Encryption Script Part 1 of 3

# In Python, create a script that utilizes the cryptography library to:

# Prompt the user to select a mode:
# Encrypt a file (mode 1)
# Decrypt a file (mode 2)
# Encrypt a message (mode 3)
# Decrypt a message (mode 4)
# If mode 1 or 2 are selected, prompt the user to provide a filepath to a target file.
# If mode 3 or 4 are selected, prompt the user to provide a cleartext string.
# Depending on the selection, perform one of the below functions. Youâ€™ll need to create four functions:

# Encrypt the target file if in mode 1.
# Delete the existing target file and replace it entirely with the encrypted version.
# Decrypt the target file if in mode 2.
# Delete the encrypted target file and replace it entirely with the decrypted version.
# Encrypt the string if in mode 3.
# Print the ciphertext to the screen.
# Decrypt the string if in mode 4.
# Print the cleartext to the screen.
